🌊 Ways to leverage EcoQuest Foundation + your web app, EcoQuest Wildfire Watch - AI-Powered Fire Safety, for the 2026 Ocean Awareness Contest

I. Turn Your Web App Into an Ocean-Focused Interactive Project
Bow Seat loves interactive tools that educate or inspire action. Your existing app provides an excellent foundation.
A. Expand the App Into an “Ocean Hazard & Conservation Dashboard”
Add modules for tsunami early-warning mapping, coastal erosion rates, sea-level rise predictions, or storm surge projections.
Include real-time or near-real-time National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or United States Geological Survey (USGS) datasets.
Visualize changes using clear graphs or maps to make ocean changes visible and emotionally resonant.
B. Add a “Policy & Action Recommendation Engine”
Provide region-specific suggestions like:
Wetland restoration
Coral reef protection
Plastic management
Coastline buffer zones
This turns the app into a tool that empowers action, a key Bow Seat value.
C. Create a Mode for Kids → Ties to EcoQuest’s Mission
Kid-friendly narrations or mini-games explaining:
Why tsunamis happen
How erosion works
How plastic travels through ocean currents
Aligns with EcoQuest's goal: environmental education for younger audiences.
D. Include a Storytelling Layer
Bow Seat heavily rewards narrative elements.
Examples:
Animated story mode explaining "A Day in the Life of a Coastline"
Visual timelines showing how climate change transforms a coast from 2020 → 2100
An interactive journey: "You are a coastal scientist: make decisions and see outcomes"

II. Create a Multimedia Narrative or Video
Use your app as the central character of a short film.
A. “Behind the App” Documentary-Style Short
Show how you built the app
Tie personal narrative → why oceans matter to you
Show how tech can help communities prepare for ocean hazards
Highlight your nonprofit, EcoQuest, as the platform for youth education
B. Storytelling Through Crisis Simulation
Film showing:
A fictional coastal town’s erosion/tsunami risk
How the app identifies threats and suggests prevention
A hopeful tone: youth-led innovation for ocean resilience
C. Human-Impact Story
Interviews with teachers or kids who used your EcoQuest game/app
Show how education → awareness → action

III. Submit a Creative Writing Entry Using Your Project as the Anchor
Bow Seat emphasizes personal voice + environmental insight.
Examples of themes:
“How Building My Tsunami-Warning App Taught Me to Listen to the Ocean”
“A Coastline That Speaks: What Data Shows Us About a Drowning Shore”
“Code as Activism: A Teen’s Mission to Protect the Ocean Through Technology”

IV. Develop an EcoQuest Ocean Curriculum
Bow Seat rewards projects with community impact.
You can create:
A downloadable set of ocean hazard lessons
Simple experiments explaining erosion with sand/water
Printable conservation worksheets
An illustrated storyline that pairs with your app
This expands EcoQuest's reach and provides a tangible deliverable.

V. Use Your Web App to Create Data Visualizations
Convert live data (wave height, flood risk, sea-level rise (SLR) projections) into artistic visual patterns
Create a "Data Art Triptych":
Panel 1: Healthy coast
Panel 2: Present risks
Panel 3: Future projections
Overlay with personal narrative or community voices

VI. Build an Ocean Conservation Game Under EcoQuest
Your nonprofit is a natural vehicle.
Possible game concepts:
Rebuild the Coast: restore dunes, plant mangroves, fortify coral reefs
Tsunami Escape: learn evacuation routes
Stop the Shrinking Beach: strategize erosion-control methods
Submission: either the game itself or a video explaining it.

VII. Create a Web-Based Interactive Story (“Click to Explore Our Changing Coast”)
Bow Seat loves innovation + narrative.
Concept:
Users scroll through a coastal scene
As they scroll, erosion progresses
Pop-ups show scientific facts
End with “What You Can Do” prompts (activism)

VIII. Tie Everything Into a Youth-Activism Narrative
You already have:
A nonprofit
A web app
A commitment to environmental education
Bow Seat loves youth-led activism → perfect synergy.
You can frame your submission around:
“How Growing a Youth Environmental Tech Nonprofit Helped Me Learn to Protect the Ocean.”
