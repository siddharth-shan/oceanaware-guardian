1. What inspired you to create this app?

What inspired me to create EcoQuest Wildfire Watch was seeing how wildfires have become such a serious problem in California and the West Coast. Every summer, it feels like the skies turn orange somewhere nearby, and people have to evacuate their homes. I’ve always been interested in the environment, especially through my experience in Boy Scouts, where we spend a lot of time outdoors learning about nature, fire safety, and survival skills. Seeing how fire can both help and harm ecosystems made me realize how important it is to understand wildfire risk before it’s too late. One day during a camping trip, our troop had to cancel a hike because of poor air quality from a nearby wildfire. That really stuck with me. It made me think about how unpredictable wildfires are and how little most people know about their own risk. I wanted to build something that could help communities be more aware and prepared, even if they don’t live right next to a forest. That’s when the idea for my app came to me. EcoQuest Wildfire Watch lets users enter their location and instantly see their wildfire risk level, along with useful tips about staying safe and protecting their surroundings. I wanted it to be simple enough for anyone to use but powerful enough to make a difference. My goal was to combine my interest in technology with my passion for the outdoors to create something that helps people and the environment. Developing the app taught me how technology can be a tool for environmental protection. By giving people information about their wildfire risk, it encourages awareness and prevention, which are key to reducing damage. Creating this app made me feel like I was taking action, not just learning about problems but actually doing something to help solve them.

3. What improvements would you make if you were to create a 2.0 version of your app? 
    If I were to create a 2.0 version of EcoQuest Wildfire Watch, I would focus on making it more interactive, accurate, and community-driven. The first version lets users enter their location to see wildfire risk levels and learn about safety tips, but there’s so much more potential to expand on that idea. I’d also like to include push notifications that warn users when wildfire risk increases in their area, or when a fire is detected nearby. This kind of alert system could help people take action earlier, like preparing emergency kits or checking local evacuation routes. Another big improvement would be creating a community reporting feature, where users can share updates like smoke sightings, fire hazards, or blocked roads. This would help build a network of people working together to stay informed and safe.Finally, I’d work on improving the design and accessibility so the app is easy to use for everyone, including people in rural areas with slower internet or older phones.

4. What did you learn or take away from participating in the Congressional App Challenge? *
Participating in the Congressional App Challenge taught me a lot more than just coding or app design. It showed me how technology can be used to make a real difference in people’s lives. When I started working on EcoQuest Wildfire Watch, I wanted to build something meaningful that connected my interest in the environment with my growing passion for computer science. Through the challenge, I learned how to turn an idea into a working app that could actually help people stay safe. One of the biggest things I learned was how important it is to understand your users. I had to think about what people really needed to know about wildfire risk and how to make that information clear and easy to access. That meant researching wildfire data, learning about APIs, and testing my app with others to get feedback. It pushed me to think like both a developer and a problem solver. I also learned a lot about perseverance. There were times when my code didn’t work or data wouldn’t load, and I had to figure out how to fix it. I realized that failure is part of the process, and every mistake taught me something new about debugging, design, or time management. Another takeaway was how inspiring it was to see other students’ creativity. Everyone had such different ideas, and it reminded me that technology can be used for anything—from health to education to the environment. It made me want to keep improving my skills and maybe even pursue a career where I can combine tech and sustainability.
