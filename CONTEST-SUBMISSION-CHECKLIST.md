### 📝 4. Written Description (TODO)

**Required:** Short project description (150-300 words)
**Use Case:** Contest submission form, social media, press

**Draft:**

> OceanAware Guardian is a comprehensive ocean conservation platform that combines cutting-edge AI education with hands-on marine science. Through six integrated learning experiences, students from ages 6-18 discover ocean threats, learn conservation solutions, and develop the technical skills needed for tomorrow's environmental careers.
>
> Our breakthrough feature, AI Ocean Guardian, teaches students to train machine learning models that identify marine life versus ocean pollution—the same technology used by real conservation organizations like Flukebook.org. As users label training images, they learn about AI bias, ethics, and the importance of quality data in building responsible technology.
>
> Beyond AI, the platform includes Captain Marina's Ocean Journey (an interactive 5-chapter storybook), scroll-based climate storytelling (2020→2100), artistic data visualizations, ocean sound sonification, educational games (Tsunami Escape, Rebuild the Coast), and complete NGSS-aligned curriculum with lesson plans and experiments.
>
> Built by a youth developer inspired by a childhood beach that's slowly disappearing to coastal erosion, OceanAware Guardian transforms overwhelming climate data into beautiful, empowering experiences. We don't just teach about the ocean—we prepare students to build the AI systems, analyze the satellite data, and create the innovations that will protect our oceans for generations to come.
>
> The ocean sustains us. The ocean protects us. The ocean inspires us. Now it's our turn to become ocean guardians.
