OceanAware Guardian vs. Past Bow Seat Winners
(2023–2025): Analysis and Recommendations
Strengths of Past Interactive & Multimedia Winners (2023–2025)
Rich Storytelling & Personal Narrative: A compelling story or personal angle is a hallmark of
many winning entries. For example, the 2023 Gold-winning podcast “Unsung Climate Hero” told an
immersive story of a Berber mountain guide in Morocco, featuring first-hand interviews about
ancient farming methods and climate impacts . The student podcaster spent days trekking and
interviewing locals, then centered her submission on this narrative of an “unsung” hero, making
the climate crisis feel personal and urgent . Likewise, the Bamboo Bike interactive game (Junior
Gold 2023) had a clear narrative thread: a friendly turtle character guides players through tasks
(picking up ocean trash, planting trees, building a bamboo bike) while introducing real-life hero
Bernice Dapaah’s story . These works read like stories rather than just presentations of facts,
which helped judges connect emotionally. The strong storytelling in past winners demonstrates an
artistic voice and imagination that judges prize , allowing complex environmental issues to be
conveyed through relatable narratives.
Community Engagement & Impact: Past winners often extend their impact beyond the screen by
engaging communities or inspiring action. Many entries highlight community heroes or invite
participation. The Junior team behind the “Sea Life” board game (2023) chose a multiplayer board
game format specifically to educate family and friends together about beach cleanups inspired by
activist Afroz Shah . Their reflection notes that playing the game with others helps “spread the
word” on reducing plastic, showing an intent to galvanize their community . Similarly, the 2024
Junior Gold website “3 Degrees” doubled as a fundraising and advocacy platform: it not only
informed viewers about global warming but also featured a quiz and a donation link for a local
#GoElectric initiative, encouraging users to take real-world action (funding electric cookers for the
community) . Even digital projects found ways to be participatory – for instance, a 2023 AR filter
project invited social media users to wear ocean-themed AR masks and share them, blending
fashion, tech, and activism . Many winners drew on local or youth communities (interviewing
neighbors, collaborating with school clubs, etc.), grounding their work in tangible impact. This focus
on community-driven change amplified the entries’ resonance and showed judges that the artists
were not only creative but also active young conservationists.
Interactivity & Innovative Formats: Winning entries in this category leveraged creative interactive
formats to engage their audience, often in playful or immersive ways. Games and multimedia
experiences featured prominently. In 2024, Senior Gold winner “Island City” was a simulation game
challenging players to manage a city’s carbon emissions and keep temperatures down – essentially
teaching climate science through gameplay . It even presented a built-in story/tutorial about
global warming’s seriousness to drive the message home . Another standout, “Bamboo Bike Maker
Bernice Dapaah,” built in Scratch, let users drag-and-drop items and answer questions to learn how a
Ghanaian entrepreneur built bikes from bamboo . This highly interactive approach turned

learning into a hands-on experience. Other winners mixed media in novel ways: the “Turning the Tide”
entry (2023) structured a climate podcast as a game show (blending quiz elements with audio
storytelling), and the “AR Masks: Plato’s Atlantis” project used augmented reality fashion filters to
engage users in ocean-inspired art on social platforms . There were even immersive
installations like 2025’s “Sea Life Hears More Than You,” which placed viewers in a 360° projection
room with escalating ocean noise to evoke empathy for marine life . These examples show that
winners often pushed the envelope of form – from games and AR to podcasts and physical
installations – to make their message interactive. Such innovation not only captured audience
attention but also showcased the entrants’ technical skill and creativity, aligning with the contest’s
emphasis on originality and craftsmanship .
Artistic Voice & Creativity: Despite using diverse mediums, past winners consistently demonstrated
a strong artistic voice – a unique, imaginative perspective driving the work. Many projects
combined art and science in creative ways. For instance, “Thriving Corals: Where Science Meets Art”
(2024) blended scientific data with artistic presentation (coral illustrations, likely) to celebrate reef
ecosystems, and “Patchwork for Change” wove together visuals and narrative like a textile of ideas (as
the title suggests). In the 2025 Junior division, “Blurred Boundaries” used an original performance art
concept – painted wooden cubes that the artist rotated on camera – to symbolize fragmented
habitats and our interconnected fate with wildlife . This abstract yet personal piece was
essentially storytelling through art: the faces of the cubes depicted a mountain lion’s world versus
the student’s world, merging into one message about shared habitat. Judges appreciate when an
entry’s style and medium amplify its message. Whether through vivid illustrations, evocative music,
or inventive metaphors, top entries conveyed a clear point of view. They weren’t just reporting
facts; they were interpreting the theme in a fresh, creative way. This originality and imagination in
expression are explicitly part of the judging criteria . By infusing their work with personality – be
it humor, satire, cultural perspective, or emotional depth – past winners made their pieces
memorable and meaningful. In short, the best Interactive & Multimedia submissions from 2023–
2025 married content with creativity: they told important stories about the ocean and climate, and
did so in a way that only that young artist or team could, whether through a game, a film, or an
interactive art piece.
OceanAware Guardian App: Evaluation vs. Past Winners
OceanAware Guardian is an ambitious web app platform (2025–26) that offers real-time ocean hazard
mapping, AI-driven ocean health analysis, educational quests, data visualizations, and community action
tools . In many ways, it represents a next-level interactive project, but when comparing it to the
strengths of past Bow Seat winners, a few gaps emerge alongside notable advantages:
Narrative & Emotional Hook – Potential Gap: OceanAware Guardian appears to be feature-rich
and data-driven, but it currently lacks an obvious central narrative or personal story to tie it all
together. Unlike past winners that focused on a single hero or a clear storyline, this app is structured
as a multi-feature tool. There isn’t an immediately evident character, journey, or metaphor guiding
the user’s experience (beyond the thematic framing of how the ocean sustains/protects/inspires us).
This could be a weakness in terms of storytelling: judges might not feel the same emotional pull or
personal connection that they did with, say, a podcast interviewing a climate hero or a game
following a turtle guide. The Bow Seat prompt “Your Story, Our Ocean” emphasizes personal
connection , and many winners literally shared their own or others’ ocean-related stories. By

contrast, OceanAware Guardian presents a platform of tools and information; the onus is on the
user to discover stories through data. If the app doesn’t foreground a narrative (for example, a dayin-
the-life scenario, a fictional guide character, or the creator’s personal inspiration), it may come off
as less artistically personal than other entries. In short, the app risks feeling more like a polished
research project than an art piece with a soul, unless it weaves in a human narrative thread.
🌍 Community Impact & Personal Engagement – Mixed Performance: OceanAware Guardian
clearly values community action – it includes a “Coastal Community Hub” for crowd-sourced hazard
reports and local project coordination , and even a policy recommendation engine to spur
contacting representatives and joining conservation initiatives . These features align well with
Bow Seat’s emphasis on youth activism and could impress judges as forward-thinking. However, the
community impact in the app is mostly potential. It provides a platform for organizing and learning,
but it’s unclear if any community is already using it. Past winners often demonstrated community
engagement in practice – for example, 3 Degrees actually raised funds for community needs , and
the Sea Life game creators literally participated in park cleanups and aimed to play their game with
others . OceanAware Guardian’s community hub is a powerful idea (enabling users to help each
other and share resources), but without a built-in user base or a specific community story, judges
might not feel the impact as tangibly. Additionally, because the app tackles global data (NOAA,
NASA, etc.) and broad issues, it might lose the localized, personal touch that made some entries so
compelling. For instance, the app could alert a user about coastal erosion in their area, but that
experience isn’t as inherently narrative as a student describing how sea-level rise is affecting their
hometown. In summary, the platform provides great tools for community engagement, but it may
not yet showcase a community narrative or outcome — a gap that could be addressed by integrating
user stories or pilot usage examples.
Artistic Voice & Visual Creativity – Potential Gap: From the documentation, OceanAware
Guardian comes across as a highly technical project (AI models, data layers, etc.), which is
impressive, but it raises the question of artistic voice. The app’s design and content need to convey
a creative vision, not just technical proficiency. Many winning projects had a strong aesthetic or
unique presentation style that reflected the creator’s personality or cultural background. For
instance, the AR Masks project drew inspiration from high fashion and used a bold color scheme to
make an environmental point , and Blurred Boundaries incorporated the artist’s own paintings and
props . If OceanAware Guardian’s interface is too utilitarian or its tone too scientific, it might not
score as high on originality and imagination . There is mention of an “interactive storytelling”
mode called “A Day in the Life of a Coastline” within the data visualization studio – this could be a
wonderfully artistic element if executed well (perhaps personifying a coastline over time). The risk is
that, amid maps and charts, such creative touches might get overshadowed. In comparison to past
entries, the app currently doesn’t obviously feature original artwork, music, or literary elements
created by the student – it leans on data and code. Unless the visuals (like map art, icons, layout) and
interactive scenarios are infused with creativity, the submission could appear less artistically
expressive than a hand-drawn comic or a song or a film. Essentially, the student’s technical voice
comes through clearly, but their artistic voice needs to shine through as well, so the project feels
like a piece of creative advocacy, not just a tech demo. This is an area to strengthen so that the
judges see the entrant’s imagination at work along with their coding skill.
⚖ Scope and Focus: One unique challenge for OceanAware Guardian is its sheer scope. It attempts
to cover everything from tsunami evacuation maps to coral reef AI analysis to policy tips. This

breadth is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it’s very ambitious and addresses the contest theme
from multiple angles – which could fulfill the “sustains, protects, inspires” sub-themes in a literal way
. On the other hand, judges only have so much time to evaluate each entry, and an entry that
tries to do too much might risk overwhelming them or diluting its core message. Past successful
entries usually had a clear focus or a single concept executed deeply, rather than many disparate
modules. For example, Island City zeroes in on climate and cities in a simulator , and Biscuit and
Buttercup Lend A Fin (from 2024) likely was a coherent story (the title suggests a children’s story
format). OceanAware Guardian will need to tie its many features into one cohesive experience for
the judges. If presented haphazardly, the platform’s complexity could be seen as a weakness (“trying
to do everything”) compared to a simpler, more poetic entry. However, if framed smartly (e.g.
guiding the judges through a day in the life of a user who utilizes each feature in context), the app’s
comprehensive approach can be a standout strength rather than a confusing sprawl. It’s crucial that
the submission materials (description, screenshots, video) clearly communicate why each component
exists and how they collectively tell a story about our relationship with the ocean.
Notable Strengths: It’s important to note that OceanAware Guardian also has several built-in
strengths vis-à-vis contest criteria, despite the gaps above. The project is highly interactive,
arguably more so than typical entries, giving users maps to click, images to analyze, quizzes to play,
and community posts to make. This level of interactivity is perfectly suited for the category and will
likely impress judges who see a functional web app or demo. The use of cutting-edge technology (AI
vision detecting plastic or coral health) is innovative and original, a clear differentiator – no
previous Bow Seat entry has harnessed AI in this way, so it could earn points for imagination in
problem-solving. Additionally, the app is deeply informative, embodying strong craftsmanship and
research: it integrates real NOAA, NASA, and USGS data and even calculates an “Ocean Health
Score” with multiple indicators . The accuracy and depth of content can boost the project’s
credibility (as long as it remains accessible). And critically, OceanAware Guardian addresses the 2026
theme directly – its features map exactly to how the ocean sustains (resources and climate
regulation data), protects (hazard protection tools), and inspires (storytelling and community
activism) . In terms of meeting contest requirements and theme alignment, the student has
clearly been thorough. These strengths mean that, if the app’s presentation is refined, it has the
potential to wow judges by showing that a student not only understands the issues but also
created a functional solution. The key will be to package these strengths with a dose of storytelling
and artistry so that the entry engages the heart as well as the mind.
Features of OceanAware Guardian That Will Impress Judges
Despite some differences from traditional entries, OceanAware Guardian has several features likely to stand
out positively to contest judges:
Multi-Faceted Interactivity: The app isn’t just one interactive element – it’s many in one. Judges
exploring it (or watching a demo) will encounter maps, sliders, quizzes, and community boards. This
goes beyond a typical “point and click” website. For example, the Ocean Hazard Intelligence Map
lets users toggle layers (tsunami zones, erosion rates, etc.) and even see predictive timelines for sealevel
rise . Such rich interactivity can deeply engage users in learning about ocean risks in a way a
static infographic cannot. Likewise, the educational quests (e.g. Tsunami Safety Detective or
Microplastic Hunter) turn knowledge into a game . This gamification element will likely appeal to

judges as a creative teaching tool – much like previous game-based winners, but with more variety.
Overall, the hands-on nature of the platform aligns perfectly with the Interactive category’s spirit.
Cutting-Edge Tech & Innovation: OceanAware Guardian’s integration of AI and real-time data is
highly innovative for a student project. It features an AI-powered vision module that can analyze
coastal images for pollution or coral health , employing advanced machine learning models. This
kind of technology-driven approach is unique; it shows the student pushing the boundaries of what
youth artivism can encompass. Judges will likely remember an entry that, for instance, can scan a
photo of a beach and identify plastic trash – that demonstrates originality in tackling ocean
conservation. The platform essentially repurposes emergency tech (from the student’s previous
wildfire app) for marine conservation , exemplifying creative problem-solving. This “high-tech”
artistic innovation complements the more traditional art forms in the contest and can set the entry
apart as forward-thinking. As long as it’s clearly the student’s own work (and not just an AI doing
everything), this tech-savvy angle will be a strong asset.
Depth of Content & Educational Value: The judges also consider how accurately and effectively an
entry communicates environmental issues . Here, OceanAware Guardian shines with wellresearched
content. It doesn’t just mention problems vaguely – it provides data, visual evidence,
and context. The Data Visualization Studio component, for instance, includes an interactive
timeline of sea-level rise from 2020 to 2100 and global ocean heatmaps . This gives viewers a
clear, factual picture of climate trends, enhancing the persuasive power of the piece. By combining
science and interactive visuals, the app educates in a compelling way (much like Bow Seat’s own
Resource Studio does). The inclusion of features like a Marine Biodiversity tracker or a “Day in the
Life of a Coastline” story mode indicates an effort to translate scientific data into relatable stories or
visuals . Judges appreciate when student work is not only creative but also informative and
accurate. OceanAware Guardian’s comprehensive approach can convince judges that the creator has
a strong grasp of marine science and climate issues – strengthening the entry’s impact.
Clear Call-to-Action & Empowerment: One of the most exciting aspects of OceanAware Guardian is
how it doesn’t stop at raising awareness – it actively guides users toward solutions. The
Conservation Action Recommendation section provides personalized ideas for local actions
(wetland restoration, beach cleanups), policy advocacy tips, and ways to get involved in citizen
science . This feature aligns perfectly with Bow Seat’s mission of turning creativity into action. It
shows that the student wants to empower others to protect our blue planet, not just inform them.
Judges tend to respond well to entries that inspire hope or action rather than despair. For example,
the theme of the 2023 contest was to uplift climate heroes making a difference , and here the app
essentially tries to turn the user into a climate hero by recommending advocacy steps. Such a
positive, solutions-oriented tone can leave a strong impression. It demonstrates maturity and
leadership – the contestant isn’t just saying “here’s a problem,” but also “here’s what we can do.” This
proactive spirit, combined with the community hub (where users can coordinate real conservation
projects or share resources), makes OceanAware Guardian more than an art piece; it becomes a tool
for real-world impact. That kind of tangible empowerment is likely to be seen as a big plus.
Alignment with Contest Theme: Finally, judges will immediately notice how directly OceanAware
Guardian fits the 2026 theme “Your Story, Our Ocean: How Our Ocean Sustains, Protects, and Inspires
Us.” The app’s very structure mirrors the sustains / protects / inspires framework . Each major
module corresponds to one of those facets – for example, ocean sustains us is reflected in features

about resources and climate regulation data, ocean protects us comes through the hazard and safety
tools, and ocean inspires us is embodied in the storytelling, educational quests, and art/activism
components. This clear thematic coherence will not be lost on the judges. It shows that the student
thoughtfully responded to all parts of the prompt, which is crucial since entries are evaluated on
how well they address the theme . By explicitly breaking down the theme and covering it through
interactive experiences, OceanAware Guardian demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of
“Our Ocean, Our Story.” This thoroughness in theme alignment, combined with the innovative
medium, is likely to score highly. In essence, the app transforms the theme’s abstract idea into an
interactive reality – a place where anyone can explore how the ocean supports us, how we can be its
guardians, and how that relationship can inspire action.
Recommendations to Strengthen Storytelling, Artistic Voice &
Impact
To bridge the gaps identified and elevate OceanAware Guardian to its fullest potential, here are targeted
recommendations:
1. Introduce a Cohesive Narrative Thread: Incorporate a storytelling element that guides users
through the app’s features in a meaningful way. For example, you could create a fictional guide or
mascot (perhaps “Guardian” personified as a friendly ocean character or an avatar of the student)
who narrates the user’s journey. This character could share personal anecdotes about the ocean
(“When I was little, the tide pools inspired me to become a marine biologist…”) and prompt the user
from one section to the next. Another approach is framing the experience as “a day in the life” story:
start with a scenario (e.g. morning – a coastal town receives a storm surge alert on the hazard map,
afternoon – volunteers use the AI tool to assess beach plastic, evening – the community hub
organizes a cleanup, etc.). By tying the disparate modules into a storyline, you ensure the judges
experience the app as one flowing narrative rather than a list of tools. This will add emotional
continuity and make the submission more memorable. Essentially, let the app tell a story of how
one becomes an “OceanAware Guardian,” transforming data into a personal journey.
2. Infuse Personal Voice and Reflection: Make sure your own artistic voice and passion come
through clearly in the submission. In the written Reflection (100–300 words required) , be candid
about why you created this app and how the process has affected you. For instance, explain if a
personal experience with the ocean (a coastal visit, an environmental event, a mentor) inspired
specific features – this will connect “Your Story” to the project. Judges value authenticity and want to
understand the creator’s motivation . You can even weave snippets of your personal story into
the app itself: perhaps include a short intro message or an “About the Creator” section where you
speak about what the ocean means to you. If you have a compelling origin story (such as how you
adapted your wildfire app after witnessing an ocean issue, or how certain data opened your eyes),
share that. By highlighting your unique perspective and imagination, you’ll address the contest’s
artistic criteria head-on . In essence, don’t be afraid to be present in your work – let the judges
hear your voice, not just the voice of the code or data.
3. Enhance the Artistic & Visual Design: Strengthen the app’s artistic appeal by paying attention
to visual and auditory details. Consider creating or integrating original graphics – for example, handdrawn
icons of marine animals, a custom logo or color theme that reflects ocean aesthetics, or
33
•

background illustrations for different sections (like waves, coral patterns, etc.). If you have the skills,
you might add a short intro animation (even a simple one) that sets a creative tone when the app
loads – something like a guardian figure emerging from waves. Ensure the “Interactive Storytelling:
A Day in the Life of a Coastline” feature is presented with a narrative script or captions, almost like a
mini graphic-novel or slideshow, rather than just raw data points . This will demonstrate your
ability to translate data into art. Additionally, think about sound: gentle ocean sounds or a brief music
snippet can make the experience more immersive (just make sure any audio is original or royaltyfree).
The goal is to have the app feel as much like a creative work as it is an analytical tool. By
polishing the UI/UX with an artist’s eye – using consistent ocean-inspired imagery, engaging
typography, and visual storytelling – you’ll show judges a strong craftsmanship in your chosen
medium (digital design) . This can elevate the app from “informative” to “inspiring,” aligning with
the contest’s artistic standards.
4. Highlight Community and Human Impact: To address the current lack of an on-the-ground
community story, you can simulate or initiate one. One idea is to include a “Success Stories” or
“Impact” panel in the community hub section – perhaps present a hypothetical (or real, if possible)
example of a community using the app’s tools. For instance, “Community Spotlight: Malibu, CA –
Students used OceanAware Guardian to identify an eroding beach section, and then organized a
planting project to stabilize the dunes.” Even if this is aspirational, crafting a narrative of how the app
could make a difference for a particular community makes the impact more concrete for judges. If
you have time to pilot the app with a small group (maybe friends from a marine science club or
classmates), you could describe their feedback or actions taken. Additionally, leverage the
Community Hub in your presentation: show screenshots of a (mock) discussion thread or mutual
aid request being answered – this will illustrate the human connectivity your platform enables .
By demonstrating the app’s community aspect with story-driven examples (rather than just saying
“users can report issues”), you’ll give the judges that warm sense of community engagement that past
winners conveyed. It emphasizes that your project isn’t just you and a computer; it’s about people
coming together, which is ultimately what Bow Seat is trying to encourage.
5. Streamline the Presentation for Judges: Given the complexity of OceanAware Guardian, be very
deliberate in how you present it in your submission materials. It’s recommended to create a short
video tour (under 5 minutes, per guidelines ) that walks through the app’s main features in a
logical, narrative order. Use this video to tell the story of the app (as suggested in Recommendation
#1) so the judges can easily follow along. Narrate the video or use on-screen text to explain what’s
happening and why each feature matters (“Here our guardian AI analyzes a beach photo – notice it
flags pieces of plastic, informing our next cleanup quest…”). A video will let judges see the
interactivity and wow factors without any setup hassle. Along with the video, select up to 5
screenshots that best represent the app’s highlights . Choose images that are visually striking
and self-explanatory: for example, the hazard map with colorful layers, the AI analysis output
highlighting pollution, a quest page with its game-like interface, a data graph with an “Inspire” story
caption, and the community forum screen. Caption each image (in the description) with one
sentence that ties it to your ocean story or the theme. Also, use the required short description
wisely – concisely describe the concept and how a user engages with the app (as if writing
instructions or an overview) . Clarity here will ensure judges don’t get lost. By curating the
experience for them, you prevent the scope from becoming a liability. In sum, guide the judges as
users through your creation, just as you would guide an everyday user, making it easy for them to
appreciate every facet of your project.

6. Emphasize Theme Alignment and Creativity in the Reflection: When writing your reflection
(artist’s statement), explicitly connect OceanAware Guardian back to the contest theme and subthemes,
so judges have no doubt you hit the target. You can say, for instance: “I wanted to explore
how the ocean protects us – thus I built the hazard maps to show its protective role and how we can
protect ourselves. To show how it sustains us, I included data on resources and climate regulation.
To inspire others, I created storytelling quests and a platform for action.” This shows intentional
design around the theme . Additionally, use the reflection to underscore your creative process
and originality: describe how you brainstormed combining technology with art, any challenges you
overcame (learning a new framework, training an AI model, etc.), and what makes your approach
unique. Maybe mention that you were inspired by previous Bow Seat artworks or by a desire to make
scientific data engaging and interactive, which is a fresh take on storytelling. According to the
contest guidelines, judges do consider the content and authenticity of reflections , and a good
reflection can help your entry “do better in the Contest” . So, make it heartfelt and insightful.
Convey how creating the app changed or reinforced your perspective on the ocean (e.g. “Through
developing this project, I learned how interconnected our community is with the ocean’s health, and
I felt empowered turning data into action”). A strong reflection will effectively be the voice of your
project, adding depth and meaning to the technical work. It’s your chance to address any subtle
points that didn’t fit elsewhere (like ethical considerations, hopes for the future, or inviting the
judges to imagine the app’s impact). By hitting all these notes, you ensure the judges fully grasp the
passion and creativity behind OceanAware Guardian, not just the impressive tech.
By implementing these recommendations, OceanAware Guardian can achieve a better balance between its
high-tech innovation and the storytelling artistry that Bow Seat judges admire. The end goal is to have the
app match the strengths of past winners – engaging narrative, community relevance, interactivity, and
creative voice – while still leveraging its unique features. In doing so, the OceanAware Guardian app will not
only stand out as a cutting-edge entry but also resonate on a human level, increasing its chances of making
a lasting impact on the judges and the Bow Seat community.
